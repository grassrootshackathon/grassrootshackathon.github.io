          <p>After graduating from Louisiana State University, Josh joined Teach for America and taught two years in Baton Rouge, LA and also taught another year in Madrid, Spain.

During Josh’s third year of law school at the University of Arizona, Colorado and Washington voted to legalize cannabis for adult-use.  Knowing the systematic inequities also surrounding cannabis prohibition, these historic acts convinced Josh of the opportunity for legitimate business and social justice within a burgeoning legal cannabis industry. Josh co-founded the Cannabis Commodities Exchange (CCX) and the Greene Consulting Group and has gained intimate experience in the cannabis industry. With CCX, Josh and his team are servicing the cannabis industry by providing a transparent, online marketplace for legal cannabusinesses to buy and sell cannabis products at wholesale. With his team at the Greene Consulting Group, Josh has helped clients in Colorado, Washington, Illinois, and beyond to gain approval for their cannabis business licenses and the right to take part in this incredible industry.</p>

          <h5>General Manager North America, SendinBlue</h5>
          <p>Michael Grabham by nature, is a fearless leader. He is a curious start up guy that has been delivering revenue, new products and creative marketing in startup and turnaround chaos for 20+ years. He is a five time founder and is in relentless pursuit of knowing the customers better than any competitor. A “make it happen” person driving growth across multiple revenue streams while inspiring and teaching employees on how to have fun and get things done. He has managed marketing, engineering and sales staffs throughout his career. Most of all, he loves entering new cities or unfamiliar markets and forming brilliant teams full of passionate, innovative, really, really smart people; be they creative visionaries, growth-driven salespeople, intrepid strategists, meticulous operations honchos or all of the above. As Seneca once said (because he was a really, really smart guy), "Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. Be prepared, damn it." Not sure he said that last part.  He is constantly learning from startups, helping smart people change industries, studying consumer behaviors and searching for the perfect glass of wine. He received his MBA from Seattle University and has an undergraduate degree in Mathematics. He lives in Seattle with his wife and two cats.</p>
