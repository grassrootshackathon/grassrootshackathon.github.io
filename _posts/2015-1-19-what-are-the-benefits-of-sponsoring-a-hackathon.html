<p>Event organizers are often asked: "What do sponsors get out of these events
   they spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on?" It's a fair enough question
    - to a lot of people, the benefits to sponsoring an event like a hackathon
    or startup competition can be hard to spot.</p>

<p>The most common benefits to sponsoring a hackathon:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increase your brand exposure </strong>from the joint marketing
  efforts of event organizers, partner sponsors, brand champions, and
  yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Expand your brand's "thought leadership" within your
  industry </strong>by sponsoring and writing a guest blog post or having
  company leaders serve as coaches at the event, for example.</li>
<li><strong>Interact with talented, smart, and passionate individuals </strong>
  who share interest in your industry, some of whom may be looking for
  employment - saving you hefty recruiting fees.</li>
<li><strong>Network with thought leaders from your industry </strong>
  (and others) in the form of our industry-expert coaches, judges, and speakers,
   as well as fellow sponsors and company reps.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage use of your technology </strong>by offering a prize for
  best use of your technology by a team, and having personnel on-hand to ease
  technical integration and act as brand evangelists.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's also worth noting that hackathons are exciting and energetic events,
  and that energy can often spill over to the day job for attendee and sponsor
  alike.</p>
