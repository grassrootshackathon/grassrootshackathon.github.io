<p>GrassRoots is for anyone excited about the intersection of cannabis and technology. You don't need to be a veteran programmer or experienced entrepreneur to attend – you just need to be passionate about cannabis and willing to spend a weekend building and launching a company.</p>
<p><span id="more-77"></span></p>
<p>Because we designed GrassRoots to be more like a startup competition (like Startup Weekend or 3 Day Startup) than a “true” hackathon, we're not only allowing, but ENCOURAGING non-technically-skilled people to attend. Sure, it helps if you know how to code or are a graphic designer, but there's more to launching a startup than the product!</p>
<p>Below is a brief list of what might be expected of a GrassRoots attendee, but this list is by no means exhaustive:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical skills -&nbsp;</strong><em>(in order to build the minimum viable product so the idea can be validated)</em></li>
<li><strong>Design skills -&nbsp;</strong><em>(in order to make the product and presentation clear and visually-appealing)</em></li>
<li><strong>People skills -&nbsp;</strong><em>(in order to talk to potential customers, and to market and sell the product)</em></li>
<li><strong>Leadership skills -&nbsp;</strong><em>(in order to stay organized and get things done in a short-time frame)</em></li>
<li><strong>Creativity -&nbsp;</strong><em>(in order to create new ideas and businesses that solve real problems)</em></li>
<li><strong>Domain expertise -&nbsp;</strong><em>(in order to understand the problem well enough to solve it properly)</em></li>
<li><strong>Entrepreneurial spirit -&nbsp;</strong><em>(in order to provide experience and show grit when things get tough)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>While checking off most/all of these boxes would make you anyone's dream candidate, fitting just one is really all we're looking for! <img src="http://grassrootshackathon.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif.pagespeed.ce.sphHKcO2zc.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" pagespeed_url_hash="2897327646"> If you fit one or more of these criteria, we'd love to see you at the event!<i> </i>If you still aren't sure if GrassRoots is right for you, please email us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:GrassRootsHackathon@gmail.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','mailto','GrassRootsHackathon@gmail.com']);">GrassRootsHackathon@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;with any questions!</p>
