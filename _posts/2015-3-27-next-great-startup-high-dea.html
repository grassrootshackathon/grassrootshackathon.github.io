<p>The newly-legal cannabis industry is in the news a lot lately, and for good
  reason: it's America's fastest growing industry, expected to grow by 64% in
  2015 and create 200,000 new jobs. But as the saying goes, oh-so popular
  amongst entrepreneurs, "You can mine for gold, or you can sell pickaxes."
   <span id="more-303"></span>The people who made the most money in the good ole
    days of the California Gold Rush weren't those panning for gold, but rather
    the ones supplying them. While businesses today are FAR more savvy than the
    prospectors of yore, there's still a lot of validity to the saying.</p>
<p>What we're doing at GrassRoots Hackathon is creating an event where people
  passionate about technology and cannabis can join forces to make the digital
  pickaxes for this new Gold Rush - the Green Rush. There are a bunch of
  problems still un-solved (or under-solved!) in the emerging infrastructure of
  the newly-legal cannabis industry. Cy Scott, cofounder of Leafly, put it quite
   succinctly: "The cannabis industry has many unmet needs and missing services,
    a perfect space for entrepreneurs to come in and accelerate adoption of
    cannabis recreationally and medically"</p>
<p>Here's our growing list of a few of those problems, submitted from people in
  the cannabis industry:</p>
<p>Software/hardware to automate cannabis grow-ops<br>
3D printing with hemp-crete<br>
Resistive heating elements for vaporizers<br>
Hemp &amp; cannabis compounding software<br>
Open-source wiki on cannabis (StickyIckyWiki?)<br>
Affordable small-scale lab equipment to test quality in-house<br>
"Breathalyzer" for cannabis<br>
Mobile apps for cannabis users</p>
<p>We know there are a lot more problems than that, and we want to help solve
  them. Hit us up with your suggestions on Twitter at @hackGrassRoots, or email
  us at grassrootshackathon@gmail.com</p>
