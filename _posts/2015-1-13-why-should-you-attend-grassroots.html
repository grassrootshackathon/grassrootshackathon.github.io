<p>There are a lot of great benefits to attending a hackathon or startup competition. Here's what we've come up with for GrassRoots:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expand your network -&nbsp;</strong>Be around other professionals (sponsors, coaches, and fellow attendees) who are passionate about both technology and cannabis</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Find a co-founder -&nbsp;</strong>Truly get to know someone by working together on a project, and you might just find the yin to your yang and do amazing things together.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span id="more-80"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Find a job within the industry -&nbsp;</strong>Many of our sponsors are hiring, or you may meet someone who knows the right person</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Learn something new -&nbsp;</strong>With so many talented people together and so much being done, even a hardened startup-veteran may learn something valuable</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Launch a company -&nbsp;</strong>While the event only lasts a weekend, absolutely nothing prevents teams from continuing to work on their project!</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Food and drink -&nbsp;</strong>For the ticket price of $100 you get 7 meals throughout the weekend, without having to cook or clean</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Have fun -&nbsp;</strong>Work hard, play hard! In addition to all the cool people you'll meet, we'll have beer and wine on-hand, with a cannabis-friendly afterparty following the event on Sunday</li>
</ul>
