The recent explosion of popularity in cannabis as an industry is fascinating and thought-provoking.  Although perhaps too early to call, it seems reminiscent of the development of the technology industry - at first mistrusted, then grudgingly accepted, until becoming a part of everyday life.

The more I think on it, the more similarities I see between technology and cannabis:

 - **Power to improve quality of life.** Technology in medical advancement has allowed us to live better, for longer, than ever before, and cannabis is helping people with seizures, wasting diseases, cancer treatment, and more.
 - **Opponents who fear what they don't understand.**  Technological innovation has often been decried at first - we've witnessed this from germ-theory and doctors' hand-washing (or lack-thereof), to nuclear energy and artificial intelligence.  Cannabis has been under prohibition for 8 decades due to propaganda, misinformation, economics, and racism.
 - **Proponents who mean well but don't speak "mainstream".**  Technology has been, and will continue to be, driven by those beautiful souls who balance the knife's edge between genius and madness; who envision the future, and through determination and hard-work, bring it to life.  Cannabis' proponents have, until recently, lacked the ability to effectively communicate their message to the "mainstream" in order to counter government propoganda on ganja.
 - **Spark creativity and empower innovation.**  The primary reason we're seeing such an explosion in technological innovation recently is due to the exponential power of creation, as knowledge and technology build on knowledge and technology.  And anyone who doubts the power of cannabis in sparking creativity has OBVIOUSLY never used it.  :-)
 - **Vulnerable to misuse.**  Technology is capable of so much that is good and positive, but can also be used for evil - biological warfare, nuclear weapons, etc.  Cannabis is also vulnerable to misuse - not that in terms of physical harm, but mental.  Just like alcohol, or gambling, or over-eating, or many other types of addiction, some people can become so enamored of it, they give over control of their lives to their addiction and squander their potential.

It's time to legitimize cannabis as an industry, and by combining cannabis with technology, we can further push the boundaries of innovation.  We've only begun to scratch the surface of what cannabis can do - it's gonna be a fascinating ride.
